## What is AI?

AI, or artificial intelligence, involves the creation of intelligent algorithms capable of learning from data. This course specifically delves into Generative AI (Gen AI), a type of AI capable of generating new content, akin to human abilities such as writing essays, solving math problems, and excelling in art competitions.

Gen AI, while immensely beneficial, necessitates human guidance for optimal performance. Comparable to new interns at a company, Gen AIs possess significant capabilities but require clear directives to excel. Effectively providing instructions to Gen AIs is a valuable skill. This is typically achieved through prompts, which are text instructions (e.g., "Provide 5 ice cream flavors"). Gen AIs specializing in text comprehension and generation are referred to as large language models (LLMs).

Prompts can be written in any language and can sometimes consist of images, audio, or other mediums.
