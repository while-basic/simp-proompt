<h4>Introduction to Generative AI and Prompt Engineering</h4>

Welcome to the ultimate, no-cost guide on Generative AI, the current global sensation. Designed for those entirely new to the concept of AI, including non-technical individuals, this course serves as the ideal entry point into the world of Generative AI and Prompt Engineering. For those with a technical background, the subsequent modules are packed with valuable insights.

Generative AI encompasses technologies capable of producing new content, including text and images, akin to human creators. It's anticipated to revolutionize our work dynamics (see: *potential impact on employment*). Amidst the widespread excitement and confusion surrounding Generative AI (Gen AI) and Prompt Engineering (PE), discerning factual information can be challenging.

Our research across the web has gathered the most effective strategies and tools, benefiting over 1.3 million readers from prestigious organizations such as OpenAI, Brex, and Deloitte. We continually update our guide to bring you the most current insights. Experience firsthand how Gen AI can dramatically reduce your workload with a brief demonstration.

## Example of Time-saving with Generative AI

One of the best ways we've found to save time using Generative AI involves automating the process of **email composition**. This includes generating responses, editing emails, and crafting messages for cold outreach, which collectively saves us countless hours every week. By providing a *prompt* to an AI, we instruct it to create a complete, formal email tailored to our needs.

:::tip
A prompt is essentially a command or set of instructions given to an AI. More details will be covered in the following lesson.
:::

<AIInput>
{`As the CEO of a mid-sized enterprise, I need a brief, humorous, yet professional email drafted to my regional manager requesting:
- an updated list of our paper stock
- the organization of a meeting this week with the other regional managers
- feedback on the recent company-wide AI workshop held at their location`}
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
Subject: Paper, Strategic Gatherings, and AI Adventures

Dear [Regional Manager's Name],

Hope this message finds you more exhilarated than a cat chasing a laser pointer. In a lighter vein, my recent musings on our paper stock have taken a rather amusing turn, imagining a world where we resort to using palm leaves for reports! To avoid such an amusing yet impractical scenario, could you please provide an updated inventory of our paper stock?

Moving on, the echoes in my office are becoming all too apparent, signaling it's time for a get-together with our regional managers this week. Rest assured, this will be a no-nonsense meeting, free from any clichÃ©d team-building exercises. Kindly coordinate to find a suitable time for everyone.

On another note, rumors of our recent AI workshop have reached my ears, sparking curiosity. How did it unfold? Was it a scene of AI rebellion, or are we still in charge? I'm eager to hear your insights and any feedback gathered.

Awaiting your swift reply. The responsibility of our paper reserves, the effectiveness of our upcoming meeting, and potentially the course of human-AI relations are in your capable handsâ€”no undue stress intended!

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]

This example showcases how Generative AI can craft emails that are both light-hearted and professional. By tweaking the *prompt*, the tone and style can be adjusted to our preference, even mimicking our writing style. It can also assist in refining pre-written emails, demonstrating Generative AI's capability to significantly reduce the time spent on email communication.

## Course Overview, Ethos, and Philosophy

In this section, we provide an overview of the course structure, including our ethos and philosophy, teaching approach, and the modules you'll encounter. This course is open-source, welcoming anyone to explore its underlying code, and has been crafted by a diverse group of contributors, including researchers, translators, and enthusiasts. Our core belief is that AI should be universally accessible and presented in a manner that is both clear and unbiased. Accordingly, we've developed this comprehensive course to be devoid of unnecessary technical jargon and hype, ensuring it's approachable for all.

## How We Teach

Our teaching methodology for prompt engineering is anchored in three core principles. First, we prioritize practicality by concentrating on research-supported, practical techniques that can be directly applied to your projects and applications. Second, we ensure the inclusion of accessible examples to elucidate the application and timing of various techniques. Lastly, we advocate for collaborative learning. Many learners discover that sharing their progress and insights on platforms like Twitter accelerates their learning process.

## Modules

**Basics**: Introduction to prompt engineering and core techniques<br/>
**Basic Applications**: Straight forward, practical applications of prompt engineering<br/>
**Intermediate**: Research-based PE techniques with moderate complexity<br/>
**Applied Prompting**: Research informed PE process walkthroughs contributed by community members<br/>
**Advanced Applications**: Complex and potent prompt engineering applications.<br/>
**Reliability**: EBoosting the dependability of large language models (LLMs).<br/>
**Image Prompting**: Techniques for text-to-image models, such as DALLE and Stable Diffusion.<br/>
**Prompt Hacking**: Creative and unconventional prompt engineering strategies.<br/>
**Tooling**: Overview of prompt engineering tools and development environments.<br/>
**Prompt Tuning**:  Enhancing prompts with gradient-based methods.br/>
**Miscellaneous**: Various additional topics and methods in prompt engineering.

## ## Article Difficulty Rating System

We've developed a system to classify articles by difficulty and required technical knowledge:

ðŸŸ¢ Beginner; no need for programming skills.<br/>
ðŸŸ¡ Easy; requires only fundamental programming knowledge, no need for specialized skills.<br/>
ðŸ”´ Intermediate; demands programming abilities and some specific knowledge (for example, understanding logarithmic probabilities).<br/>
ðŸŸ£ Advanced; necessitates extensive programming skills and deep knowledge in the field (such as mastery of reinforcement learning strategies).

It's worth mentioning that articles marked with ðŸ”´ and ðŸŸ£ are designed to be understandable even without prior expertise in the subject, though having it might aid in practical application.



## Feedback

The single most important part of this course is your feedback!<br/>

[^a]: Generative AI already appears to have claimed some jobs(@Verma_Vynck_2023), and slowed hiring at Bloomberg(@IBM_Do_2023). However, consider the news on its impact with a grain of salt. We expect more jobs to be *changed* rather than lost.
[^b]: The AI used here is GPT-4.
[^c]: We have read 100s of research papers and articles to find the best techniques.
